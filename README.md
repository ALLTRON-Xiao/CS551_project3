# mysh - A Minimal Unix Shell

## Overview

**mysh** is a custom shell designed to offer basic Unix shell functionalities in an interactive environment. This project aims to provide a lightweight and user-friendly command-line interpreter that supports:

- **Command Execution:** Running commands with arguments.
- **Background Execution:** Using `&` to execute commands in the background.
- **Signal Handling:** Managing signals like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, and Ctrl+\ to ensure smooth user interactions.
- **Job Management:** Providing a `jobs` command to display and manage active background processes.

The shell continuously accepts user input and provides feedback similar to traditional Unix shells.

## Features

- **Interactive Command Execution:** Type commands and see immediate results.
- **Background Processing:** Append `&` to commands to run them in the background.
- **Robust Signal Handling:** Properly handles interrupt, stop, and quit signals.
- **Job Control:** Easily list background jobs with the `jobs` command.

## Getting Started
